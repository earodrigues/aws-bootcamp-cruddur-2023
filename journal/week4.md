# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

## Required homework

I was able to create an RDS postgres instance, connect gitpod to RDS, create cognito trigger to insert user into db, create a lambda function and create new activities with insert commands. I runned into a few problems:
- For the lambda function I was getting an error executing the insert when I pass de *params (function takes at most 2 arguments (5 given) insert) so I've changed to cur.execute(sql,(user_display_name,user_email,user_handle,user_cognito_id))
- For creating new activities with a db insert, I was getting an error returning null uuid so I realized through logging that I had to change the user_handle in the app.py data_activities(): user_handle = 'erodrigues'
