## Homework Challenges

### Decouple JWT verification into a middleware
I've implemented the JWT verification in what I think is a middleware. I did it using the same library that we wrote in the bootcamp (cognito_jwt_token.py) and I managed to make it work. Idealy, we can put this together with the library outside our application.
